Problem Statement:-

 A monkey is given ‘n’ piles of bananas, whereas the ‘ith’ pile has ‘a[i]’ bananas. An integer ‘h’ is also given, which denotes the time (in hours) for all the bananas to be eaten.

Each hour, the monkey chooses a non-empty pile of bananas and eats ‘k’ bananas. If the pile contains less than ‘k’ bananas, then the monkey consumes all the bananas and won’t eat any more bananas in that hour.

Find the minimum number of bananas ‘k’ to eat per hour so that the monkey can eat all the bananas within ‘h’ hours.

Examples
Example 1:
Input Format: N = 4, a[] = {7, 15, 6, 3}, h = 8
Result: 5
Explanation: If Koko eats 5 bananas/hr, he will take 2, 3, 2, and 1 hour to eat the piles accordingly. So, he will take 8 hours to complete all the piles.  

Example 2:
Input Format: N = 5, a[] = {25, 12, 8, 14, 19}, h = 5
Result: 25.
Explanation: If Koko eats 25 bananas/hr, he will take 1, 1, 1, 1, and 1 hour to eat the piles accordingly. So, he will take 5 hours to complete all the piles.


Before moving on to the solution,let’s understand how Koko will eat the bananas. Assume, the given array is {3, 6, 7, 11} and the given time i.e. h is 8. 


First of all, Koko cannot eat bananas from different piles. He should complete the pile he has chosen and then he can go for another pile.

Now, Koko decides to eat 2 bananas/hour. So, in order to complete the first he will take
3 / 2 = 2 hours. Though mathematically, he should take 1.5 hrs but it is clearly stated in the question that after completing a pile Koko will not consume more bananas in that hour. So, for the first pile, Koko will eat 2 bananas in the first hour and then he will consume 1 banana in another hour. 

From here we can conclude that we have to take ceil of (3/2). Similarly, we will calculate the times for other piles.


1st pile: ceil(3/2) = 2 hrs
2nd pile: ceil(6/2) = 3 hrs
3rd pile: ceil(7/2) = 4 hrs
4th pile: ceil(11/2) = 6 hrs

Koko will take 15 hrs in total to consume all the bananas from all the piles. 


Observation: Upon observation, it becomes evident that the maximum number of bananas (represented by 'k') that Koko can consume in an hour is obtained from the pile that contains the largest quantity of bananas. Therefore, the maximum value of 'k' corresponds to the maximum element present in the given array.


So, our answer i.e. the minimum value of ‘k’ lies between 1 and the maximum element in the array i.e. max(a[]).


Now, let’s move on to the solution.

Brute Force Approach :
Algorithm / Intuition
Naive Approach(Brute-force): 
The extremely naive approach is to check all possible answers from 1 to max(a[]). The minimum number for which the required time <= h, is our answer.

CODE: 

function findMax(v) {
    let maxi = -Infinity;
    let n = v.length;
    // Find the maximum
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        maxi = Math.max(maxi, v[i]);
    }
    return maxi;
}

function calculateTotalHours(v, hourly) {
    let totalH = 0;
    let n = v.length;
    // Find total hours
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        totalH += Math.ceil(v[i] / hourly);
    }
    return totalH;
}

function minimumRateToEatBananas(v, h) {
    // Find the maximum number
    let maxi = findMax(v);
    // our search space is from - [1, max of array]
    // Find the minimum value of k
    for (let i = 1; i <= maxi; i++) {
        let reqTime = calculateTotalHours(v, i);
        if (reqTime <= h) {
            return i;
        }
    }

    // Dummy return statement
    return maxi;
}

let v = [7, 15, 6, 3];
let h = 8;
let ans = minimumRateToEatBananas(v, h);
console.log("Koko should eat at least " + ans + " bananas/hr.");

Complexity Analysis :
Time Complexity: O(max(a[]) * N), where max(a[]) is the maximum element in the array and N = size of the array.
Reason: We are running nested loops. The outer loop runs for max(a[]) times in the worst case and the inner loop runs for N times.

Space Complexity: O(1) as we are not using any extra space to solve this problem.

Optimal Approach
Algorithm / Intuition
Optimal Approach(Using Binary Search): 

Complexity Analysis :
Time Complexity: O(N * log(max(a[]))), where max(a[]) is the maximum element in the array and N = size of the array.
Reason: We are applying Binary search for the range [1, max(a[])], and for every value of ‘mid’, we are traversing the entire array inside the function named calculateTotalHours().

Space Complexity: O(1) as we are not using any extra space to solve this problem.
